THE FIGHTING MONGOOSES

What we're about

Our team consists of 4 long-term friends who have put in hours to train and have been competing in local tournaments for several years. We're committed to pursuing long-term goals of competing in global eSports tournaments.

We keep a consistent, on-message social media presence and are looking to grow our fan-base as our audiences see our passion and dedication to this game. At this stage, we are reaching out for sponsorships to help take us to that next level.
